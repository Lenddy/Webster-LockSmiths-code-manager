!!!!!todo!!!!
have the validation for the key codes to be just a string of at lest 5 pairs (10 char) of one letter one number  or  max or 6 pair (12 char)   or just pairs of numbers  

have the front dor be fill with  front back door or gates 



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!upddddateeeeeee


they want that the codes be on tob of each other 
example: D S S Q S
         2 4 2 3 4



managers
    name: String
    cellNumber: string
    address[
        {
            address: string ,
            city: string 
            state: string
            zipCode: string|numbers
        }
    ] ,

    keys
        [
            {
                keyWay:string|Number
                keyCode: string|Number
            }
        ]







you need a table (management) that holds the
1 name of the manager 
2 itemsManage  (this is the relation on to many )

3 name is a string that can change 
4 itemsManage is a array of objects that contains multiple files address, keyWay , KeyCode



You need a table (address) that holds the 
address:string




you need a table (key) that holds 

keyWay: string
keyCode: string (on letter one word  with a space in the middle that is the  example : Q4 B3 B2 Q4 K3 (unique))







!!!!!!!!!


so you need to make a overview 

the manager will have a 
addresses array
and a keys array 



they will all be connected to   

so      this address belong this managers and that address can have multiple key



!!!!!







in other word 


managers
    address[
        {
            address: string ,
            city: string 
            state: string
            zipCode: string|numbers
        }
    ] ,

    keys
        [
            {
                keyWay:string|Number
                keyCode: string|Number
            }
        ]





to add 

make the table 

it will be a one to many table 

there will be a management

management :

name : string
itemsManage : [string]  




key codes
    address
    key way 
    key codes :[string]
