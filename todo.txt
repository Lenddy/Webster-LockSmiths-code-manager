managers
    name: String
    cellNumber: string
    address[
        {
            address: string ,
            city: string 
            state: string
            zipCode: string|numbers
        }
    ] ,

    keys
        [
            {
                keyWay:string|Number
                keyCode: string|Number
            }
        ]







you need a table (management) that holds the
1 name of the manager 
2 itemsManage  (this is the relation on to many )

3 name is a string that can change 
4 itemsManage is a array of objects that contains multiple files address, keyWay , KeyCode



You need a table (address) that holds the 
address:string




you need a table (key) that holds 

keyWay: string
keyCode: string (on letter one word  with a space in the middle that is the  example : Q4 B3 B2 Q4 K3 (unique))







!!!!!!!!!


so you need to make a overview 

the manager will have a 
addresses array
and a keys array 



they will all be connected to   

so      this address belong this managers and that address can have multiple key



!!!!!







in other word 


managers
    address[
        {
            address: string ,
            city: string 
            state: string
            zipCode: string|numbers
        }
    ] ,

    keys
        [
            {
                keyWay:string|Number
                keyCode: string|Number
            }
        ]





to add 

make the table 

it will be a one to many table 

there will be a management

management :

name : string
itemsManage : [string]  




key codes
    address
    key way 
    key codes :[string]
